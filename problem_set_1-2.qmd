Please upload your completed assignment to the ELMs course site (under the assignments menu) and to your class Github repository. You need to upload both your Quarto document (with R code, as needed) and its rendered output (either as a PDF or HTML file).

**Total points: 25**

::: callout-note
To complete this problem set, you will need access to the `polisciols` R package. This package is not published on CRAN[^1], so you will need to install it using the following code:

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("hgoers/polisciols")
```

Remember, you only need to do this once on your computer. Run this in the console. Do not include it in your Quarto document.
:::

[^1]: The [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) hosts many R packages that can be installed easily using the familiar `install.packages()` function. These packages have gone through a comprehensive quality assurance process. I wrote `polisciols` for this class and will update it regularly. I, therefore, will not host it through CRAN: the quality assurance process takes too long to be practical for our weekly schedule. Instead, you are downloading it directly from its Github repository.

The [American National Election Studies](https://electionstudies.org/) surveys a representative sample of US voters prior to and following each US Presidential Election. We will use their survey from the last US Presidential Election (held in 2024) to learn more about US voters.

::: callout-tip
The `nes2024` data set in the `polsciols` R package provides you with a selection of the hundreds of questions the ANES asked of all `r nrow(polisciols::nes2024) |> scales::comma()` respondents to the 2024 survey. Each row provides data for one respondent.
:::

**For this problem set, only include observations for which full responses were recorded (exclude those who, for any question included in the dataset, refused to answer it, didn't know the answer, or have missing responses).**

## Question 1

Prior to the 2024 US Presidential Election, the ANES asked respondents their highest level of school completed or highest degree received.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(skimr) 
library(janitor) 
library(countrycode) 
library(ggsci) 
library(RColorBrewer) 
library(paletteer) 
library(devtools)
library(polisciols)

skim(nes2024)
```

### Part A

*Points: 2*

What was the most common highest level of education obtained by respondents? What was the least common? *Use the `education` variable from the `nes2024` data set to answer these questions.*

```{r}

nes2024 %>% 
  select(education) %>% 
  table()

```

```         
So according to data, the Some post-high school, no bachelor’s degree is the most common highest level of education. The least common level of education is Less than high school.
```

### Part B

*Points: 2*

Describe the distribution of the total number of respondents that obtained each highest level of education. Include a plot of those counts.

```{r}

HighestEducation <- 
  nes2024 %>% 
  select(education) %>% 
  mutate(count = 1)

HighestEducation %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(totalcount = sum(count, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = totalcount, y = education, na.rm = T)) +
  geom_col()+
  theme_minimal()
```

The Some post-high school, no bachelor’s degree is the most common highest level of education. The least common level of education is Less than high school. And a notable share of cases fall into missing or non-substantive categories.

## Question 2

The ANES also asked each respondent how often they pay attention to what is going on in government and politics. Let's use these responses to learn more about how much attention US voters pay to politics ahead of a Presidential election.

### Part A

*Points: 2*

How often did individuals pay attention to what was going on in government and politics? What was the most popular level of attention? What was the least? *Use the `attention_to_politics` variable from the `nes2024` data set to answer these questions.*

```{r}

nes2024 %>% 
  tabyl(attention_to_politics) 
```
The most popular level is Most of the time; The least popular level is Never.


### Part B

*Points: 3*

Describe the distribution of the total number of respondents who provided each answer to this question. Does this distribution indicate that individuals tend to pay very little, a moderate, or a lot of attention to politics prior to a US Presidential Election? Include a plot of these counts in your answer.

```{r}
payattention <-
  nes2024 %>% 
  select(attention_to_politics) %>% 
  mutate(count = 1)

payattention %>% 
  group_by(attention_to_politics) %>% 
  summarise(totalcount = sum(count, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = totalcount, y = attention_to_politics, na.rm = T)) +
  geom_col()+
  theme_minimal()
 

```


This distribution indicates that, prior to a U.S. Presidential Election, individuals tend to pay a lot of attention to politics.

## Question 3

Examine the following vector of (fake) student IQ test scores:

```{r}
iq <- c(
  145, 139, 126, 122, 125, 130, 96, 110, 118, 118, 101, 142, 134, 124, 112, 109, 
  134, 113, 81, 113, 123, 94, 100, 136, 109, 131, 117, 110, 127, 124, 106, 124, 
  115, 133, 116, 102, 127, 117, 109, 137, 117, 90, 103, 114, 139, 101, 122, 105, 
  97, 89, 102, 108, 110, 128, 114, 112, 114, 102, 82, 101
)
```

### Part A

*Points: 3*

Find the five-number summary, mean, and standard deviation for these data. Do you think any of these students might be outliers in this distribution? If so, what IQ test score did they get and how do you know?

```{r}
summary(iq)

skim(iq)

```

The five-number summary:

The max is `r max(iq)`

The min is `r min(iq)`

The median is `r median(iq)`

The first quartile is `r quantile(iq, .25)`

The third quartile is `r quantile(iq, .75)`

The mean is `r mean(iq)`

And standard deviation is `r sd(iq)`

The IQR is `r IQR<- quantile(iq, .75) - quantile(iq, .25)` `r IQR`

There is no data above `r  quantile(iq, .75) + 1.5 * IQR` and less than `r quantile(iq, .25)-1.5 * IQR`

so there are not outliers 

Part B

*Points: 3*

In large populations, IQ test scores are standardized to have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. In what way does the distribution among these students differ from the overall population? Do not use the words and phrases "mean" or "standard deviation" in your answer.

The distribution of data with large populations is normal distribution.

```{r}
ggplot()  + geom_density(mapping = aes(iq), fill = "#8D2F25")
```

From the picture, we can see that compare with the normal distribution, the distribution among these students are more skew to left, and more concentrates to the mean.

So students as a group are smarter than overall population.

## Question 4

*Points: 4*

The ANES collects information about each respondent's demographics, including their race, age, household income, and party affiliation. Provide the "type" (categorical or continuous) of variable each of those demographic characteristics represents.

Categorical: Race, Age, party affiliation

Continuous: Household income

## Question 5

The ANES also asked respondents prior to the election to rate Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on a scale from 0 to 100.

### Part A

*Points: 3*

Plot all respondents' answers to these two questions on a single density plot. There are several peaks in these distributions. What do these peaks have in common? What might they suggest about how people answer questions that ask them to provide a single number along a large range?

```{r}
NesCandidate<- pivot_longer(
  data = nes2024, 
  cols = c('therm_harris', 'therm_trump'),
  names_to = "candidate",
  values_to = "Rate") %>% 
  group_by(candidate) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7, aes(x = Rate, fill = candidate)) + labs(
    title = "Rate Harris and Trump on a scale from 0 to 100") +
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#274753", "#8D2F25"))
  
NesCandidate
  
```

Both of the peaks are at 0, it might suggest about people trend to answer the smallest value for show their dislike when they answer questions that ask them to provide a single number along a large range.

### Part B

*Points: 3*

President Trump won this election. Would you predict this outcome from the way this representative sample responded to these questions? Provide a brief description of the reasoning behind your answer.

It is difficult to predict the outcome from this sample because:

1.  We lack evidence that strong disapproval of Trump translates directly into support for Harris (and vice versa); the relationship between the two measures is unclear.

2.  The demographic composition of the respondents is not specified, which limits our ability to generalize.

3.  There may be selection bias, as individuals who participate in such polls are often those with at least some post-high school education and a strong interest in politics.
